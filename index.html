                    <h2>Technological Intrests</h2>
                    <p>I have always had a thing for technology so I started learning about computers and other technologies there is from my 6th Grade and I still do.I did my C and C++ certification from NIIT during the year 2011 then I joined VIT did my masters in software engineering and along with my college I did my java certification from NIIT again. I learnt a few technologies on my own like perl, php, python, .NET.I learnt to use designing, developement, testing, metrics and management softwares.I always didn't find frontend intresting yet I wanted to learn it.Now I am more interested in machine learning and data analysis</p>

                    <h4 style="font-family: cursive">Remote computing</h4>
                        <p>I developed a software which take the data which has to be processed from the computer and sent it to a more powerful computer(powerful processor) processed the required information and returned to the clients computer by using this method we can run powerful processing with low end computers.</p>
                    <h4 style="font-family: cursive">Women's safety Application</h4>
                        <p>To understand the features of Google's Firebase I developed an application to check out the features and while testing the system found out that it can track the user's phone which can be used for many purposes so that made me think to make an application for women's safety which includes sending a text to SOS members, Last know location if the device is switched off and also this was used to find friends who had the application installed on the device. </p>
